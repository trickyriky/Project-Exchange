# Project-Exchange
Basic Spec Sheet, for Project-Exchange

Intent
to build a crypto currency, any coin for any coin exchange platform, in nodejs with suplimental software support (redis, mongo, etc).
Exchange is to have the following features
  1. Any coin for any coin (all pairs) most important non negotiable.
  2. A troll box, with ignore user option, and calc feature (without a secondary bot) popout would be nice. maybe irc integration.
  3. Hot and Cold Wallets, (will likely require 2 machines just for the wallets, and 2x ssl certificates).
  4. a strong secure database if not 2x database, with a 3rd as backup / redundancy. (getting to load balance levels here, may need to look at rackspace)
  5. a script automating wallet ownership and control of database entries pertaining to deposits withdraws and trades.
  6. automated cron job to check coins nethashrate on a 24hr basis, throw warning for potential delist if no hash provided in 7 days.
  7. no fiat currencys or user verification, 2fa would be advantagous via authy maybe google
  8. a fee system for trades & withdrawals (making profit here is open to debate)
  9. paid voting system for the listing of coins, premines, ito ico will never reach this list.
  10. meet the team static webpage, with links to social media, maybe a facebook group we all frequent rather than individual profiles, not sure any other exchange has this so would be a good from marketting perspective.
  11. Social media Presence for the exchange, maybe integrated with the front end.
